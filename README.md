# Welcome to the Bank of America Digital ID project

This repo contains the working code for the FinLit app.

## Cloning and running this package for the first time

    Projects> git clone https://github.com/omgitsomg/bofaReactNative.git
    Projects> cd bofaReactNative
    Projects\bofaReactNative> npm install
    Projects\bofaReactNative> npx react-native start
    Projects\bofaReactNative> npx react-native run-android

Uh oh - sometimes this doesn't work.  Depending on your machine and your emulator, it might
take a significant amount of time for the emulator to start-up.  To get around this,
start android-studio, open the **Virtual Device Manager** and start your desired emulator.  Once this is done, you can **npx react-native run-android** all you want!

## Useful commands mentioned in Discord
